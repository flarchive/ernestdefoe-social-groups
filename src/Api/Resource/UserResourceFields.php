/**
 * Appends the social-group fields to the core UserResource:
 *
 *   • `sgPrimaryGroup` — the author's chosen primary-group chip rendered in
 *     post headers.
 *   • `sgGroups` — every group the user is visibly a member of, which is what
 *     the user-card badges render.
 *
 * Both ride on the serialized user so the UI needs NO extra requests. That is
 * the whole point of `sgGroups`: the badge component used to fire one
 * `GET /api/sg-user-groups/{id}` per rendered user card, so a page listing 28
 * users (a follower list, a member list, a user index) fired 28 separate HTTP
 * requests, each booting Flarum and opening its own DB connection. On shared
 * hosts that cap new connections per second that burst exhausts the pool and
 * every request on the forum starts failing with
 * `SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Operation not permitted` — the 500s look like they
 * come from this extension's endpoint, but the endpoint is just the victim of
 * its own fan-out.
 *
 * Every serialized user's memberships come from UserGroupBatch: each getter
 * queues its user and returns a deferred value, and the first one resolved
 * loads every queued user at once. Three queries per request however many
 * authors the page has, and through however many include paths they arrive.
 * Private groups stay gated to their own members and admins, and a stale
 * primary row (set, then the member left or was kicked) shows no chip.
 *
 * GroupAssetUrl is constructor-injected (replacing an in-getter resolve()).
